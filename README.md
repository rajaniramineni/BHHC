# BHHC
This Demo site is built using an angular app and a Graphql api back end, we are using Apollo graphql to communicate from angular to graphql
To run this app, pull the code, go into BHHCApi folder and run 'dotnet run' command from command prompt 
once api is up and running go into BHHCClient and do 'ng Serve' which should run the client app
